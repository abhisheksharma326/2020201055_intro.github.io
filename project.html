	<p>This is my major project for B.Tech. and in this project ,fine tuning is done with the help of pretrained models like VGG16,VGG19 and InceptionV3. Which were used to extract the features from the dataset.Then with the help of classifiers the result were generated.I along with my btech mates have published a research paper over the problem statement.

	<p>In this project with the implication of machine learning algorithms,Pneumonia is detected with the help of chest X-ray scans.Features of the images were extracted using MPEG7 and PCA helped in achieving dimensionality reduction.Then with the help of classifiers we classified the data into respective categories like normal and infected persons.Later on I along with my friends have published a research paper over the problem statement.</p>

	<p>In this project Gujrat elections twitter dataset is used, in which we have used the concept of TF-IDF and bag of words technique to generate embeddings and then with the help of classifiers results were collected.Tweets were classified as positive,negative and neutral.</p>

	<p>Here in this project I have performed multiple image processing tasks like image smoothening,RGB to grayscale conversion,edge detection using multiple filters ,image cropping,image rotation,image blurring etc.All of this is done using threads and whole of the programming is done in C language</p>
